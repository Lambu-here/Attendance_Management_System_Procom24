Dear Team Leader,

We hope this email finds you well and excited for the upcoming event, PROCOM'24. As team leads, it is essential for you to follow certain procedures to ensure smooth registration and participation for your team.

Attached to this email, you will find unique QR codes assigned specifically to your team. These QR codes will serve as the key to collect participant cards for your team members.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

1Ô∏è‚É£ QR Code Collection: Please ensure that only the designated team lead retrieves the QR codes attached to this email. If your team is participating in multiple competitions, you will receive multiple QR codes, one for each competition.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Registration Desk: Upon arrival at the entrance gate, the team lead must present all the QR codes associated with your team at the registration desk. Our staff will scan each QR code to verify their participation in the respective competitions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Participant Cards: Once all QR codes are successfully scanned, participant cards will be provided to your team members. It is crucial that the entire team is present at the registration desk during this process.

Additionally, please ensure that your team arrives at least 30 minutes prior to their competition time. Procom will not be held responsible for any inconvenience caused due to teams arriving with insufficient time.

üìù Please note the following:

üî¥ Responsibility: Failure to present all QR codes at the registration desk will result in the inability to collect participant cards. Procom24 will not be held responsible for any inconvenience caused due to non-compliance with this procedure.

üî¥ Team Presence:  The presence of the entire team at the registration desk is mandatory for the collection of participant cards. Individual team members will not be able to collect their cards separately. If any of your members are absent, rest of the team must be present with their team lead during entry. No additional team members can enter afterwards; only one entry per team is allowed.

We appreciate your cooperation in following these instructions to ensure a seamless experience for everyone involved. If you have any questions or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Best regards,
PROCOM'24 Organizing Team
